* INTRODUCTION

The "Alpm" module is a binding for the Ocaml language that allows low
level access to ArchLinux's package management.

** ALPM
The ALPM acronym stands for ArchLinux Package Manager (I believe). The
standard ArchLinux package utility uses libalpm for tasks such as
keeping track of installed packages, installing packages, checking
conflicts, etc. Libalpm is a C library that is bundled with pacman.

* INSTALLATION

This project uses ocamlbuild, a replacement for the GNU make utility.
A shell script is included called "build.sh" which wraps ocamlbuild to
closely resemble a make sequence.

The following example untars the project archive, cd's to the new
extracted directory and then builds and installs the project
using ocamlbuild and ocamlfind.

: tar xf ocaml-build-1.0.tar.gz
: cd ocaml-build-1.0
: ./build.sh
: ./build.sh install

Allowable arguments to ./build.sh include "clean", "all", or "install".

You must have findlib installed in order to install the "alpm" package
into the system-wide location. The "install" rule won't work without it.

* DOCUMENTATION

Documentation will be embedded inside the Ocaml source code. I still
have not yet got around to documenting it. I will probably not document
heavily because I may be the only one using this. If you know how to use
libalpm from C you can figure out how it works. Look at the Alpm.mli
file for the exposed classes, functions, and data types.

* TESTS

One day I would like to use oUnit for an automated testing framework.
Currently there are a few tests programs that are included in the
test/ directory. These also give you an idea how to use the
Alpm module.
